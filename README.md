# n-body simulation

![demo.gif](./demo.gif)

## Build

Install [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html).

```
$ meson setup build
$ ninja -C build
$ ./build/n-body
```

## Usage

```
$ ./n-body -h
Usage: n-body
	-h Print this message
	-b Number of body (default: 1000)
	-w Number of workers (default: 1)
	-m Assign a random mass to bodies and draw that mass
		(all bodies have the same mass by default)
	-i Body initialization method (default: circle)
		Available: uniform, circle
	-g Gravity (default: 0.000500)
UI Controls:
	Escape/Q: Quit
	Space:    Pause
```

### Optimization ideas

- [x] quadtree
- [x] multithreading
- [x] quadtree with external node containing 4 bodies and computing 4 force at a time with AVX2
- [ ] store quadtrees in a dynamic array and reuse that array when rebuilding the quadtree (would save a lot of malloc time)
- [x] Naive approch on GPU
- [ ] quadtree on GPU (possible by putting the quadtree's node in an array)
- [x] ~~compute the force between 2 bodies and **apply** that force to **2** bodies (we compute the force twice now)~~
    Will not be done: Would be too complicated to write since there is a ton of approximation with quadtrees.
